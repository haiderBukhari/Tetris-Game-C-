# Tetris-Game-C-
Tetris Game developed in C++ programming Language including SFML Graphics and Audios

This project is solely made in ubuntu Linux VS CODE.

For installing the g++ in linux and type the command

sudo apt-get install g++

After installing the g++ compiler install VS code or you can do it with normal gedit commands.

After doing that download the folder that I have attached as a zip

Now install the SFML graphics Library either in VS code terminal or normal Linux Terminal

sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
